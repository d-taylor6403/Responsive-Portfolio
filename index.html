            <p>Dannielle Taylor is a budding coder that enjoys writing       procedures and baking cupcakes for her home bakery The Chubby Hubby Bakery. Her motto is "Life Is Short: Eat Dessert First!" which is how she approaches any project in    life: with Passion and Curiosity. As a budding coder and African American woman, Dannielle wants to create a space where she can use her coding skills to make the web a prettier place while also encouraging other young girls to do the same.<br><br>Her passion for coding and web development in particular can be traced back to the day she received her first HMTL manual, back when the internet seemed like it consisted of AOL dial-up and chat rooms.It was the vastness of the internet and its possibilities that inspired her to learn how webpages worked and that curiosity has fueled her current interest in full stack development.<br><br>Outside the office, Dannielle enjoys discovering new restraunts in her hometown of Nashville, baking gourmet cupcakes, and dedicating lots of play time to her two fur babies Ron and Lois Lane.
